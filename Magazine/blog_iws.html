						<h3>Train Derails in Uttar Pradesh</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						Utkal Express, traveling from Puri to Haridwar derailed at Khatauli near Muzaffarnagar in Western UP on Saturday evening, killing over 20 people and injuring at least 200.
						The railways announced a compensation of Rs. 3.5 lakh for the family of those killed and Rs. 50,000 for those seriously injured. 
						Following the incident, four railway officials have been suspended and chief track engineer of Northern Railways has been transferred.
						Three other officials have been sent on leave. The accident comes less than a year after the Indore-Patna Express derailed near Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh in November, 2016, leaving over 100 dead.
						Uttar Pradesh Police's ADG (Law and Order) said on Sunday that there was no proof as of today, that the derailment of Utkal Express could have links to any terror outfit's involvement at Khatauli in which 22 people lost their lives.

						<h3>Amid Doklam standoff, Center wants to speed up road along the China border</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						 Concerned over inordinate delays in the construction of strategic roads along the India-China border, the defence ministry has delegated more administrative and financial powers to the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) for the speedy completion of the projects.
						 The decision to give additional powers to BRO came months after the Comptroller and Auditor General also took strong objection to the long delays by the BRO in constructing 61 strategically important roads, with a total length of 3,409km, under the India-China Border Roads (ICBRs) project.
						The defence ministry said in a statement today it intended to bring transformational changes in the BRO to improve the pace of execution of work and to achieve the desired outcome according to the requirements of the Army.

						<h3>US, South Korea Begin Computer-Simulated Drills Amid North Korea Tensions</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						SEOUL:  South Korean and U.S. forces began computer-simulated military exercises on Monday amid tensions over North Korea's missile and nuclear programmes, amid reports that Pyongyang has generated at least $270 million since February despite U.N. sanctions.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the joint drills, called Ulchi Freedom Guardian, were purely defensive and did not aim to raise tensions on the peninsula.

"There is no intent at all to heighten military tension on the Korean peninsula as these drills are held annually and are of a defensive nature," Moon told Cabinet ministers.

"North Korea should not exaggerate our efforts to keep peace nor should they engage in provocations that would worsen the situation, using (the exercise) as an excuse," he said.
					The joint U.S.-South Korean drills will continue to Aug. 31 and involve computer simulations designed to prepare for war with a nuclear-capable North Korea.
